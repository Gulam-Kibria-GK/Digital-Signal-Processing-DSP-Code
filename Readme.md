# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Code Collection

This repository contains practical Python implementations of fundamental Digital Signal Processing (DSP) operations, written in a simple, step-by-step manner. These codes are designed for students and beginners who want to learn DSP concepts by writing and running discrete-time signal processing functions from scratch.


## Why This Repository?

Understanding DSP concepts deeply requires hands-on practice with signal manipulation. This repository provides code that helps you:

- Visualize discrete-time signals using plots
- Learn core DSP operations such as addition, mirroring, shifting, scaling, and downsampling
- Understand how signals are represented by index and amplitude arrays
- Develop the skill of handling signal lengths and indexing carefully in Python


## What You Will Find

Each module is a Python script that:

- Defines a DSP operation on discrete-time signals as `(indices, values)` pairs
- Carefully manages signal alignment by adjusting indices before performing operations
- Uses `matplotlib` for clear stem plots of signals before and after processing
- Includes comments and structured code for easier understanding and modification

| [`Scaling`](https://github.com/GK-CPP/Digital-Signal-Processing-DSP-Code/blob/master/Code/scaling.py)       | Scale signal amplitudes                           |
| [`Subtracting`](https://github.com/GK-CPP/Digital-Signal-Processing-DSP-Code/blob/master/Code/subtracting.py)   | Subtract one signal from another                  |


## How to Use These Codes

- Clone the repository using  
  `git clone https://github.com/GK-CPP/Digital-Signal-Processing-DSP-Code.git`  
  then navigate to the Code directory.

- Install the required Python packages if you haven’t already:  
  `pip install numpy matplotlib`

- Run any DSP example script by typing a command like:  
  `python Adding.py`

- Observe the plots and outputs generated by the scripts.

- Modify the signal indices and values inside the script files to explore different DSP scenarios and better understand signal processing concepts.


## Learning Tips

- Pay close attention to how signal indices are aligned before performing operations like addition or subtraction.

- Notice the use of zero-padding to equalize the lengths of signals before processing.

- Use the stem plots to visually grasp how signals change after each operation.

- Try extending the existing scripts or writing new ones to deepen your understanding.

- Read the inline comments carefully—they explain each step clearly.
